README
------

This is my collections of random/semi-random geeklets or scripts to be in geeklets that run under GeekTool.

here is the list of geeklets/scripts that is included:

*	mac\_info\_geeklet.pl
*	worldtime\_geeklet.pl (w/ worldtime\_geeklet.prefs )
*	github\_scores\_geeklet.pl
*	yahoo\_weather\_geeklet.pl

check out `INDEX` for details about each geeklet/script.

Advice
======

most of these geeklets/scripts output works best with a fixed width fonts.  The best one that I have found is [DejaVue](http://dejavu-fonts.org/) Sans Mono.  That font group is released under a "Free License".
